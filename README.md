# Cloud Runner

## Description:

A simple set of scripts meant for automating the process of Linode deployment and destruction, speciically with a focus toward leveraging cloud resources to perform tasks where on prem resources are wanting. 

I'm literally just making this because 10Mbps upload speed is not even close to suitable for Bug Bounty information gathering. So these scripts are mine, edit them if you wish to suite your needs, but please dont ask me to add functionality. It's not that kind of tool.
